# Singapore Catamaran Market 2025 - Global Analysis, Trends, Forecast up to 2032

<strong>According to a recently published analytical study titled ""Global Catamaran Market Industry Analysis, Comprehensive Forecast, and Opportunities Assessment (2025–2033),"" the report provides an in-depth evaluation of market trends, growth opportunities, and projections.</strong>

A catamaran is a multi-hulled watercraft featuring two parallel hulls of equal size. It is a geometry-stabilized craft, deriving its stability from its wide beam, rather than from a ballasted keel as with a monohull sailboat. Being ballast-free and therefore lighter than a monohull, catamarans often have a shallower draft (draught) than comparably-sized monohulls. The two hulls combined also often have a smaller hydrodynamic resistance than comparable monohulls, requiring less propulsive power from either sails or motors. The catamarans wider stance on the water can reduce both heeling and wave-induced motion, as compared with a monohull.
