# Singapore Triazine Market Comprehensive Analysis, Growth Forecast from 2025 to 2032

<strong>Triazine Market Snapshot 2025-2033 provides a concise overview of market trends, forecasts, and growth opportunities over the forecast period:</strong>

A triazine is class of nitrogen-containing heterocycles. The parent molecules molecular formula is C3H3N3. They exist in three isomeric forms, 1,3,5-triazines being common.

MMA Triazine is a cyclic tertiary triamine. It is mainly used as a scavenger for sour gases like H2S and mercaptans in gaseous or liquid hydrocarbon streams.

MEA-triazine is the most commonly used chemistry for applications requiring a non-regenerative H2S scavenger. Other chemistries are available (MMA-triazine, glyoxal, zinc-based, iron-based, and others) but MEA-triazine has the highest market share because it is the lowest cost in use solution. Triazines are low cost in use despite the fact that the molar efficiency of the chemistry in capturing H2S is significantly below theoretical maximum efficiency.
