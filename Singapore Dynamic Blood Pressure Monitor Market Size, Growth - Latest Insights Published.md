ABPM measures blood pressure at regular intervals (every 15-30 minutes is typical) throughout the day and night. It is especially useful for patients in the following groups:
 To evaluate suspected white-coat hypertension in patients with hypertension and no target organ damage.
 Apparent drug resistant hypertension
 Hypotensive symptoms with antihypertensive medications
 Episodic hypertension
 Autonomic dysfunction
Because blood pressure is monitored during sleep, ABPM is useful to determine whether the blood pressure falls at night compared to daytime values. A night time fall is normal. Absence of a night time dip is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk and other endorgan damage.
Ambulatory BP monitors are fully automatic and can record BP for 24 hours or longer while patients go about their normal daily activities. Monitors measure about 4 by 3 inches and weigh about 4 lbs. They can be worn on a belt or in a pouch and are connected to a sphygmomanometer cuff on the upper arm by a plastic tube. Patients are asked to keep their arm still while the cuff is inflating and to avoid extreme physical exertion while wearing the monitor.
